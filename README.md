# Nigeria-Covid-19-Data-Analysis-for-the-Year-2020
Nigeria was severely affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, which had an effect on social institutions, education, the economy, and health. It caused delays in vaccination distribution, stressed the healthcare system, and revealed infrastructure flaws. Due to devalued currency and broken supply chains, the nation's economy went through a recession, with increased unemployment, poverty, and inflation. School closures caused significant disruptions to education by widening the learning gaps and making remote learning less successful because of poor internet access.

The country should either prohibit foreigners from entering or treat them to make them less likely to spread the disease.
Ensure people practice social distancing and the use of sanitizer and nose mask
Closure of border
For the prices of goods and services to remain stable, the nation should guarantee that the price of oil remains stable.
In order to stop the disease from spreading, those who have confirmed cases should receive the care they need.
Sufficient medical facilities and medications should be available to address verified cases.
